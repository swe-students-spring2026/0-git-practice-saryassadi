Article : [Top Software Engineering Students Can’t Get a Job Because of AI] (https://futurism.com/future-society/software-developers-ai-jobs) 

I found this article interesting because it discusses what I believe many current students across different fields are worried about, Artificial Intelligence. It first goes into how students from Stanford University are struggling to find entry-level jobs, because of AI having the same coding skills as entry-level/junior developers. However, there are research reports that show how AI is actually not the best in terms of productivity. When used by developers, its actually slowed them down, but at the same time the workers exposed to automation by AI are having enhanced productivity. The author suggests that the issue might not necessarily be AI, but economic incentives that value shareholder profits over human gains/work.

## Comment from Sarya Sadi
I found this article interesting because it highlights how AI is impacting entry-level software
engineering roles. I especially liked the discussion around productivity versus perceived
automation, which connects closely to how companies evaluate technical labor today.
